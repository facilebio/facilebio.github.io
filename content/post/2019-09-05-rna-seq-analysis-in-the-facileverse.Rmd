# Overview

This tutorial outlines how you can use the packages in the facileverse to
perform different flavors of standard-types of analyses over an RNA-seq dataset.
We will use the [rnaseqGene][rnaseqGene] bioconductor workflow as a guide so
to help us compare how analyses within the facileverse parallel those using
standard bioconductor packages.

This tutorial assumes that you have already processed the raw fastq and 
phenotypic data into a standard Bioconductor expression container, like the SummarizedExperiment provided in the [airway][airway] data package.

[airway]: http://bioconductor.org/packages/airway
[rnaseqGene]: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html#starting-from-summarizedexperiment

Let's setup our environment for analysis, the facile way.

```

## Starting from a SummarizedExperiment

Until we have provided FacileData API's for a `SummarizedExperiment`, we must
first convert the SummarizedExperiment into a FacileDataSet. If you haven't
installed the airway package yet, you should do that now.

```{r install-airway, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("airway")
```

We'll then load the `"airway"` dataset, fix up the phenotypic data found in the `colData` of the object by removing some of the columns we don't need and specifying the reference level for the `dex` covariate to be `"untrt"`, then convert the data into a FacileDataSet.


```{r convert-to-fds}
data("airway", package = "airway")
se <- airway
colData(se) <- colData(airway)[, c("cell", "dex", "albut")]
```
