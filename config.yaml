    features:
    - title: FacileData
      text: Defines a "tidy-like" API for data query and retrieval from a multi-assay datastore. A reference implementation of a facile datastore (`FacileDataSet`) is included, which uses SQLite to store subject-, sample-, and assay-level metadata and an HDF5 file to store dense high-dimensional assay data.

    - title: FacileShine
      text: Provides shiny components to interact with and retrieve data from a facile datastore.
      icon: mobile-feed
    - title: FacileAnalysis
      text: Provides modular analysis workflows for common genomics analysis tasks. A common set of methods are defined (`shine()`, `viz()` and `report()`) to provide interactive views over these results, which can be placed into a shiny application or embedded into an Rmarkdown report.
